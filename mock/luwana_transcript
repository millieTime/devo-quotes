00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,665

Prior to serving
a mission to

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,460
the West German mission.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,170
She taught for one year at

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,065
Bonneville high school
in Idaho Falls.

16
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,625
She has been employed at

17
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,060
BYU-Idaho for 33 years.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,255
Luann is married to
marshal Roberts.

19
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,710
They are parents of

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,100
seven children and
19 grandchildren.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,960
Sister Roberts has held

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,330
several colleagues in
the Relief Society,

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,585

00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,610
and has also served as

an ordinance worker in
their expert temple.

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,200
She is currently
serving as

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,470
the primary pianist
and her ward.

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,890
I am happy to pay
for the sunshine,

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,574
for the skies of
gray or blue.

30
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:24,710
For within my heart
is the song of life.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,645
I'll live, I'll work.

32
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,540
How do those are words to

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,220
a song that I
used to sing to

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,365
my young children when
they were grumpy.

35
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:36,170
Memory says is eliminated
their grumpiness,

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,570
but I cannot really
vouch for that.

37
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,280
When I thought I
was speaking about

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
happiness today,

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,830
I thought of that song

40
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,570
sung so many years ago,

41
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,760
but I was not really
sure of the words.

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,550
So I went online and
found them posted in

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,065
2016 by a woman who
I think must be LDS.

44
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,410
She said, quote, I
awoke this morning to

45
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,540
brilliant sunshine
and a song

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,285
popped from my
childhood into my head.

47
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,920
We sang it in church and

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,945
it had a catchy
little tune.

49
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:09,680
But the lyrics are
actually pretty impactful.

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,570
After all these many,

51
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,880
many years, I still
remember them.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,770
I started to really
think about what I

53
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,945
am happy about today.

54
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:20,360
Now in the present,

55
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,965
this led to the thought

56
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,750
that I could
challenge myself to

57
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,715
think about one
thing each day

58
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:28,505
that I am happy
about, unquote.

59
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:31,100
I appreciated
your responses to

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,779
the questions on
the devotional

61
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,265
discussion board.

62
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:36,380
You will find as
you participate

63
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,270
in my presentation today,

64
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,830
you will recognize some

65
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,750
of the scriptures,
activities,

66
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,730
and attitudes
you mentioned

67
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,369
that make you
happy or included.

68
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,230
It is true there are

69
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,735
many things in life
that make us happy.

70
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,790
Where we have
skies, the blue,

71
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,560
things such as an a on

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,330
a research paper
on which a lot of

73
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,800
time and effort had

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,890
been expended,
surviving well.

75
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,720
At White Glove day when

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,610
your apartment
has been checked,

77
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,560
having enough food
in your apartment

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,435
to survive another day?

79
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,160
Getting to later
from mom and dad

80
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
with cash. And yes.

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,630
Scoring a date with
that boy or girl,

82
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,415
your INR church on Sunday.

83
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:20,290
And as the lyric
say to the song,

84
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,960
I am happy for
skies of gray.

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,300
Even when the search
page research paper

86
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,595
gets a D instead of an a,

87
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,020
the oven was not clean

88
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,059
enough for white
glove approval.

89
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:34,540
Food got pretty skimpy
before payday arrived.

90
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,534
Mailbox was empty.

91
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,010
And when finding meeting
the cute girl or

92
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,010
boy learned
already engaged.

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,405
Birth or Matthew
Richardson,

94
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:49,015
BYU advancement
Vice President,

95
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:51,430
spoke at a BYU-Idaho
devotional

96
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,005
on February 2001,

97
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:57,160
2017, and related the
following experience,

98
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,995
which I have condensed.

99
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:01,580
Of all the hundreds
of papers, quizzes,

100
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,145
and exams from his
undergraduate degree.

101
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,990
He held in his hand,

102
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,820
the only thing
he saved from

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,595
his entire undergraduate
experience,

104
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:14,000
it was a Chemistry
1 05 exam.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,890
After retrieving the exam,

106
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,320
he quickly glanced at
it and saw the number

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,265
76 scrawled across
the top in red pen.

108
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,780
He felt as if someone

109
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,565
had punched him
in the stomach.

110
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,100
He started thinking
that obviously he

111
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,145
wasn't smart enough to
be at a university.

112
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,785
He pulled the dreaded
exam from his backpack,

113
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,134
hoping that he somehow

114
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,205
read the score
incorrectly.

115
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,359
But sure enough that
red 76 was still there.

116
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,830
But then he saw something

117
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,585
he hadn't noticed before.

118
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,430
His heart raised
when he saw

119
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,815
a tiny minus sign.

120
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,470
He didn't get a
76 on the exam.

121
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,830
He missed 76.
And sure enough,

122
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,160
in the corner was
the number 24.

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,100
Why did he say that
particular exam as

124
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,420
his only momentum of

125
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,300
his undergraduate
academic experience?

126
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,310
It is because
this experience

127
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,120
impacted and shaped him
insignificant ways.

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,270
He remembers that
every storm will

129
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,590
eventually break if you

130
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,570
just hold on long enough.

131
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,585
Even as the next dances
to my opening lyrics,

132
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,880
says, no cloud can

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,940
cast a shadow over
courage, such as mine.

134
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,805
So I'll sing my
song as I go along.

135
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:32,090
I'll live our
work. I'll do.

136
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,800
When I was first
thinking of

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,150
a definition
for happiness,

138
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,620
I thought of love.

139
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,735
But in my search,
what the prophet,

140
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,300
prophets have said
about happiness,

141
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,850
the term love is
not used a lot.

142
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,235
However, a quick
story about two of

143
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:48,050
my granddaughters who

144
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,330
just graduated
from BYU-Idaho.

145
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,800
And when a freshman art

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,435
major, who by the way,

147
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,850
since that clay under
her fingernails from

148
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,090
her ceramics class
makes her happy.

149
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,340
They have made me happy
as they have stopped

150
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,605
by my office to say hello.

151
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:05,330
With their Hello,
there is always

152
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,505
a hug and I loved you.

153
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,590
When they leave after
a few minutes of

154
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,675
sharing what is
happening in their life.

155
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:15,005
There was always a
hug. I love you.

156
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,720
I know a lot of parents
parting words to

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,310
their children as they
leave for the day

158
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,560
are remember who you are.

159
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,850
The parting words of

160
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,990
these granddaughters mom,

161
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,850
are, I love you.

162
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,605
Administered with a hug.

163
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:30,920
What a great way to
start a happy day.

164
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,480
In second NiFi chapter
five, verse 27,

165
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,220
NiFi States has followers

166
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,630
lived after the matter of

167
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,880
happiness to
learn what they

168
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,445
did to create this
manner of happiness.

169
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,535
I will reference
versus in Chapter 5.

170
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:47,960
And rather than post them,

171
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,460
please open your book of

172
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,935
Mormon to second NiFi,

173
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:55,610
chapter 5 and follow
along with me.

174
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,145
In Chapter 4, Lehigh died.

175
00:06:58,145 --> 00:06:59,930
And in Chapter 5 we fight.

176
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,440
We find defy, beginning
with verse 1,

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,540
crying, but she unto
the Lord, my God,

178
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,015
because of the anger
of my brethren.

179
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,880
But behold, their anchor
did increase against

180
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
me in so much that they

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,915
get sick to take
away my life.

182
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:17,360
Skip to verse 5.

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,040
And it came to pass that

184
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,705
the Lord did
warned me that

185
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:22,280
I should depart from

186
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,665
them and fly into
the wilderness.

187
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,270
And all those who
would go with

188
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,510
me wherefore it
came to pass that.

189
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,380
I NiFi to take my
family and also Zora,

190
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,700
him and his family.

191
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,775
And Sam, my elder
brother and his family,

192
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,485
and Jacob and Joseph,

193
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,750
my younger brethren,
and also my

194
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,780
sisters and all those
who would go with me.

195
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,220
And all those who would

196
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,420
go with me were those who

197
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,040
believed in the warnings

198
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,020
and the revelations
of God.

199
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,945
Wherefore they get
hearken unto my words.

200
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,000
Through these
verses, we learn

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,830
that defy sought guidance

202
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,450
from the Lord to
know what he should

203
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,520
do to ensure safety for

204
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,110
his family members and

205
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,830
close friends,
prayer and family.

206
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,170
We're an important
component in there,

207
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,385
being able to live

208
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:13,040
after the manner
of happiness.

209
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,940
If we then go to verse
ten, we read that.

210
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,000
We did observe it to
keep the judgments and

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,415
the statutes and
the commandments

212
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,619
of the Lord in all things.

213
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,315
This is a big one.

214
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,325
Joseph Smith said,

215
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:31,445
Happiness is the
object and design of

216
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,890
our existence and
will be the end

217
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,765
thereof if we pursue

218
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,625
the path that leads to it.

219
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,925
And this path is
virtue, uprightness,

220
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:42,739
faithfulness, holiness,

221
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,800
and keeping all the
commandments of God.

222
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,230
But we cannot keep
all the commandments

223
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,970
without first
knowing them.

224
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,680
And we cannot
expect to know

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,500
all our more
than we now know

226
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,480
unless we comply with or

227
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,284
keep those we have
already received.

228
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,760
In obedience,
there is joy and

229
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
peace and spotted,
unalloyed.

230
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,450
And as God has designed

231
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,045
our happiness,
he never has,

232
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,550
he never will institute

233
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,740
and ordnance or
give a commandment

234
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,665
to his people that
is not calculated in

235
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,870
its nature to promote
that happiness

236
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,225
which he has
designed and with,

237
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,010
and which will not end in

238
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,720
the greatest
amount of good and

239
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,940
glory to those who

240
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,080
become the recipients of

241
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,375
his law and ordinances.

242
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,340
The more
faithfully we keep

243
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,735
the commandments of God,

244
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,495
the happier we
will generally be.

245
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,340
Each of the profits has

246
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,825
addressed the
issue of keeping

247
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,580
all the commandments
in order to

248
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,415
choose achieve
true happiness.

249
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,100
Brigham Young
said, we are all

250
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,055
searching for happiness.
We hope for it.

251
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,900
We think we live for it.

252
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,150
It is our aim
in this life.

253
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,220
But do we live so as to

254
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,190
enjoy the happiness
we so much desire.

255
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,930
There is only one way for

256
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,760
latter-day saints
to be happy,

257
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,475
which is simply to
live their religion.

258
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,635
Or in other
words, believe in

259
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:09,320
the gospel of Jesus
Christ in every part.

260
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,060
Happiness. Where is

261
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,069
happiness, real happiness?

262
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,710
Nowhere but in God.

263
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,635
President Russell
M. Nelson has said,

264
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,630
when the focus of
our lives is on

265
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,000
Jesus Christ
and His gospel,

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,550
we can feel joy
regardless of what is

267
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,479
happening or not
happening in our lives.

268
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:32,300
In verse 12, we learn that

269
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,460
NiFi had also brought

270
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,630
the records which were

271
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,070
engraved upon
the plates of

272
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,055
brass and also the
ball or compass,

273
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,210
which was prepared for

274
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,085
my father by the
hand of the Lord.

275
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,424
According to that
which is written,

276
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:47,435
verse 13 gives the result

277
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,070
of their observing to keep

278
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,585
the commandments
of the Lord in

279
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,045
all things. It reads.

280
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:55,700
And it came to pass that
we began to prosper

281
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,300
exceedingly and to
multiply in the land.

282
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,625
Do you not think
they prospered

283
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,815
because they kept
the commandments?

284
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:06,485
This can be true in
each of our endeavors,

285
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,045
whether it be
academically,

286
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:11,825
economically, or in our
family relationships.

287
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,300
We are encouraged to

288
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,800
study the scriptures and

289
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,690
through liken them to us.

290
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,120
The Come Follow Me
curriculum has been

291
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,530
a great aid in studying

292
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,450
the Scriptures
more carefully.

293
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,250
If we liken the scriptures

294
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,870
to our personal lives,

295
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,000
we will find answers
to questions

296
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,100
and dilemmas
that we have and

297
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,500
also have a greater
understanding of

298
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,680
the workings of the
Lord in our behalf.

299
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,775
First for King, talks
about preparedness.

300
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:43,880
And I knew if I did
take the sort of Laban.

301
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,680
And after the manner
of you can make

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,720
many swords list
by any means,

303
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,460
the people who were
now called Lamanai,

304
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,925
it's should come upon
us and destroy us.

305
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:56,510
We too have to prepare
for the enemy,

306
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,165
that is st. And
then many spirits

307
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,415
he commands to destroy us.

308
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:04,625
Nifi prepared weapons
for a physical battle.

309
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,580
We need to put on the
armor of God and follow

310
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,665
the profit is walk

311
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:12,965
the covenant path to
have a spiritual win.

312
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,870
But we have also
been admonished

313
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,340
by the profits
to prepare for

314
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,110
natural disasters or

315
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,720
other disasters such
as unemployment,

316
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,345
major health problems,
a power outage,

317
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:25,460
a pandemic, a major fire,

318
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,815
weather disruption,
et cetera.

319
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,570
By having a food supply,

320
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,550
first aid kit,
and anything

321
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,145
else which are
necessities in life.

322
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:37,355
Now, beginning
with verse 15,

323
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,050
I did teach five people to

324
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,405
build buildings
and to work.

325
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:45,245
Stop there and skip
it to verse 17.

326
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:48,110
I NiFi did cause
my people to be

327
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,560
industrious and to
labor with their hands.

328
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,660
President David
O McKay said,

329
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,265
learn to like your work.

330
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,920
Learn to say,
this is my work,

331
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,665
Mike Laurie, not my doom.

332
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:03,140
He also said, next to

333
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,585
health as a means of
giving happiness.

334
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,490
I think I would name work.

335
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,220
That is why Latter-Day
Saints are so happy.

336
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,065
They have so much to do.

337
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:14,405
They have no time to
think of their troubles.

338
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:15,965
But better than that,

339
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,825
they are thinking
of others.

340
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:20,270
They are not
seeking happiness.

341
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,025
When they give others joy,

342
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,650
happiness is their reward.

343
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,990
In verse 16, leaf I

344
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,419
mentioned he get
built a temple.

345
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:30,935
If you attend the temple,

346
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,330
you know its value in

347
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,000
creating a feeling
of happiness.

348
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,280
So as nepa colony

349
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,500
lived after the
manner of happiness,

350
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,170
they had family
scriptures,

351
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,300
a temple were industrious

352
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,920
and kept the commandments

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,750
which all contributed to

354
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,465
their living after the
matter of happiness.

355
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,310
One of my stance commented

356
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,570
that what made
him happy as

357
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,615
a teenager is not what
makes him happy now,

358
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:59,480
family and service
are more important.

359
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,300
He is not as
self centered.

360
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,765
President Hinckley said,
generally speaking,

361
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,390
the most miserable
people I know are

362
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,510
those who are obsessed
with themselves.

363
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,300
The happiest people
I know are those who

364
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,825
lose themselves in the
service of others.

365
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:21,050
President Spencer
W. Kimball said,

366
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,610
when we are asked why we

367
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,215
are such a happy people,

368
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:29,195
our answer is because
we have everything.

369
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:32,105
Life with all its
opportunities,

370
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,220
death without fear,

371
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,035
eternal life with endless

372
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,940
growth and development.

373
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,180
He also said, Let
us not to try to

374
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,690
escape our work or shirk
our responsibility.

375
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,880
Let's ask ourselves
each morning,

376
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,845
what is my work today?

377
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,250
Let us lay hold on
happiness today.

378
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,620
President McKay had
a whole chapter on

379
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,290
happiness in the teachings
of David O McKay.

380
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,660
There were some
great one-liners.

381
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,525
Happiness springs
from within.

382
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,550
The first condition
of happiness

383
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,815
is a clear conscience.

384
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,305
The second is a
sense of freedom.

385
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:12,530
A third, the confidence
of self-mastery.

386
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,515
He said, The Grand T,
if you would be happy,

387
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,154
obey the principles
of the gospel,

388
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:19,610
which many of
you mentioned on

389
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,710
the devotional
discussion board.

390
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,379
President George
Albert Smith said,

391
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,345
the Lord wants
us to be happy.

392
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:28,280
That is why he
gave us the gospel

393
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,720
of Jesus Christ.

394
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,390
Why he conferred the
priesthood upon us.

395
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,640
Why he organized
this church.

396
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,440
If you will follow
the leadership,

397
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,410
the Lord and those whom
the Lord sustains,

398
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,090
you will not
fall away into

399
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,175
darkness, lose the light,

400
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,500
transgress the
loss of God,

401
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,825
and forfeit your
privileges.

402
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,220
That he is so anxious that

403
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,570
all of us should enjoy

404
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,020
the privileges
the Lord does

405
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,460
not want us to
forfeit were

406
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,665
emphasized in
brother awkward

407
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,545
as carpets devotional
address last week

408
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,230
when he spoke of the
glorious promises which

409
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,850
transport many
of us back to

410
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,025
the highest rooms
of the holy temple,

411
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:09,545
but will be fulfilled
for all the faithful

412
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:10,715
in the highest degree

413
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,695
at the celestial kingdom.

414
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:14,390
President David O McKay,

415
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,770
ask the question, where

416
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,885
does the secret
of happiness lie?

417
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,330
Then he answered,
the Savior

418
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,410
gives us the key to it.

419
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,610
When he says
The kingdom of

420
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,350
God is within you,

421
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,540
the power is within
man to choose

422
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,075
the right or to
choose the wrong.

423
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,600
Happiness is not an
external condition.

424
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,535
It is a state
of the spirit

425
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,665
and an attitude
of the mind.

426
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:38,405
State of the spirit

427
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:39,590
and attitude of
the mind were

428
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,090
mentioned several times or

429
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,325
the devotional
discussion board.

430
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,020
I had never
thought of what

431
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,565
I was taking home to God.

432
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,110
But this is what
President McKay

433
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,330
said is something we

434
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,740
can take home to God in

435
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,125
achieving which we
find true happiness.

436
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,820
And that is character,

437
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,410
what you have
made yourself

438
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,300
during this
mortal existence.

439
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,135
It may be weak.
It may be strong.

440
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:03,800
You must decide.

441
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,480
But whenever you
make a bit during

442
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,200
the 203050708100
years that

443
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,005
you spent here will be
what you take back,

444
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,320
their character and
the service you have

445
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,840
rendered will determine
your position

446
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,330
and place in
the next world.

447
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,980
I guess I would be

448
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,330
remiss if I did
not mention

449
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,150
how the world thinks
money makes us happy.

450
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,890
John Taylor said, it is

451
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,360
a mistaken notion that

452
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,430
wealth makes people happy.

453
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,200
The scriptures
tell us that he,

454
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,730
that hath eternal life is

455
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,410
rich and the Lord has

456
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,015
told us to seek after

457
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,130
the riches of
eternal life.

458
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,260
President James E. Faust,

459
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,150
second counselor to
President Gordon B.

460
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,730
Hinckley. In an article

461
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,830
entitled our search
for happiness,

462
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,155
stated the relationship of

463
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,665
money to happiness is
at best questionable.

464
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:57,140
He quoted from The
Wall Street Journal,

465
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,480
money is an article that

466
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,715
may be used as
a universal,

467
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,470
universal passport to

468
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,465
everywhere except heaven

469
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,490
and as a universal
provider

470
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,505
of everything
except happiness.

471
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,785
Most of the profits,

472
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:14,480
I read did not want,

473
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,830
want to think
that accumulating

474
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,810
wealth was a bad thing.

475
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,660
But they emphasize that
how that wealth was

476
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,840
used would determine
one's happiness.

477
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,390
President George
Albert Smith said,

478
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,060
no matter how much
you make money,

479
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,070
no matter how
you may desire

480
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,120
the things of this world

481
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,695
to make yourself happy.

482
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,290
Your happiness will
be in proportion to

483
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,820
your charity and to

484
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,965
your kindness and
to your love,

485
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,060
to those with whom you

486
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,115
associate here on Earth.

487
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:48,860
Now, turn to Mosiah
Chapter 2, verse 41,

488
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,690
where King Benjamin
is addressing

489
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,810
his people would
desire that you

490
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,830
should consider on the

491
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,420
blasted and happy state

492
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,985
of those that keep the
commandments of God.

493
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:02,465
For behold. They are
blessed in all things,

494
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,475
both temporal
and spiritual.

495
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,110
And if they hold
out faithful

496
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,250
to the end, though,

497
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,290
they are received
into heaven,

498
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,540
that thereby they may
dwell with God in

499
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,225
a state of never
ending happiness.

500
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:17,120
Or remember, remember that

501
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,385
these things are
true for the Lord.

502
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,500
God has spoken it.

503
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,875
It is my sincere
and humble prayer

504
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,510
that we all will
decide to be

505
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,490
happy in our moral state.

506
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,140
That as we wake
up each morning,

507
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,075
we will say to ourselves,

508
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,470
today, I am happy

509
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,705
for and you fill
in the blank.

510
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,730
And US President
Kimball ask us to

511
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,880
do let us ask ourselves
each morning,

512
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,175
what is my work today?

513
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,305
Let us lay hold
on happiness

514
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:47,795
today by keeping
the commandments.

515
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,810
I am grateful to our
loving Father in Heaven,

516
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,255
who is concerned
about each of us.

517
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,935
And He wants us to merit

518
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,980
never indeed happiness,
dwelling with him.

519
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,600
I am grateful
for the plan of

520
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,479
happiness and for profits

521
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,265
beginning with
Joseph Smith,

522
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:07,355
instruct us in following
the cabinet path.

523
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:10,085
I am grateful for a
frantic and predator

524
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,140
and our redeemer,
Jesus Christ.

525
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,700
And I'll discuss each with

526
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,460
you in the name of
Jesus Christ. Amen.
